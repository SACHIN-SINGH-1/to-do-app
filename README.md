# To-Do-List
This is a simple To-Do List web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. It's a great example for learning the basics of front-end development and how to manage tasks dynamically with JavaScript.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Users can mark tasks as completed.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage so that the list persists even after the page is refreshed.
